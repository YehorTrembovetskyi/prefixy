# Prefixy
### Prefix Search as a Service

Prefixy is a hosted prefix search engine that powers autocomplete suggestions. Suggestions dynamically update in response to user input, so users only see the most relevant suggestions.

Documentation is in the [docs directory](https://github.com/jayshenk/prefixy/tree/master/docs). Additional documentation coming soon!

Also see the [prefixy-service](https://github.com/jayshenk/prefixy-service) repo, which is responsible for API token generation, hosting the client javascript, and the user interface for [prefixy.io](https://www.prefixy.io/).
